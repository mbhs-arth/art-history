I created this website mainly for myself because I wanted to be able to quickly review for a test in AP Art History wherever I am. It holds an advantage over my current Art History notebook because I can put as many full-color pictures on each webpage as I want to rather than pasting black and white copies into my notebook. I hope this resource is also helpful to you too.
